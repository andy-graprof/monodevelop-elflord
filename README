 This project aims at creating a MonoDevelop color scheme with the look and
 feel of the elflord color scheme as seen in gVim.

 To use it, import monodevelop-elflord.xml in the color schemes dialog of
 monodevelop. The elflord.vim used as reference has been provided as well.

 Special Thanks to Ron Aaron, for providing this brilliant piece of modern
 texteditor aesthetics that we all know and love.
